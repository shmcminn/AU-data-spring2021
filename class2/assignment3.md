# Assignment 3: Cleaning data

First, read the [Quartz Guide to Bad Data](https://github.com/Quartz/bad-data-guide)

1. Find a "large" dataset (6+ columns, 100+ rows) that would require cleaning before you can analyze it. This can be related to your final story idea, but it doesn't have to be.
2. Save an original copy of the data as a `.csv` file
3. Use the techniques you learned in class (and the power of Google) to clean the data, while documenting _each_ action you take. 
4. Save the cleaned data as a second `.csv` file.

In your github repo, turn in `assignment3.md` with your documentation, as well as the original and cleaned CSVs.
