# Final project details

You must complete a final project for this class, either in groups or -- upon request -- individually. The project has two components:

1. A story between 1,000 and 2,000 words based substantially on a dataset, with at least two data visualizations, due by 9 a.m. on March 6.
2. In the last class (March 6), a fellow student will interview you about the piece.

The story should answer an interesting question using data. The data component of the story must be substantial, and you need to dig into the dataset. If you just read toplines off a website without actually finding and downloading or creating a dataset, that is insufficient.

Additionally, you will produce two data visualizations to include with your story. These can be prepared using any tool, provided they meet the best practices for data visualization we discuss in class. The graphics should be integrated into the piece in a way that enhances the storytelling - not merely added on as decoration. 

For the interview component, I’m looking for something like what CNN or NPR regularly does when they bring the author of an interesting story in to give some details. The interviewer must be prepared with 3 or 4 questions, and the interviewee needs to be prepared to go into detail about the story and the reporting behind it. The interviewee should, as much as possible, use non-technical language as if they were communicating to a mass audience about how they broke the story.

The final project is worth 30% of your grade. It will break down as follows:

* 15% for written story
* 5% for data visualizations
* 3% for your role as interviewer (on someone else’s topic)
* 7% for your role as interviewee

### Examples of ideas from final projects in previous terms:

* How do locations of grocery stores differ in urban and rural communities? 
* How do African-American reporters wear their hair on TV, and what does that say about the news businiess?
* How Chinese investment in the US has changed
