# Assignment 5: Story Pitch

Develop and write out your final story pitch. Plan to talk with me about it (should take about 20 minutes) during class. 

As part of your pitch, please include the following:

1. What data source(s) you plan on using (though you can always add more later)
2. Some sources you can talk to about the data or to get anecdotes from it
3. What elements in the data might be good candidates to visualize
4. What your news hook is - why is this timely?
5. What question will you answer with your data, and _why_ is it newsworthy?

You can choose whether to talk to me about the pitch before or after submitting the written pitch on Github, but both should be done by the beginning of class.

### Example 

I plan to analyze the amount of time it's taken for Supreme Court justices to be confirmed by the United States Senate. What I want to find is if the party in control of the Senate is different the president's party, does it take longer for justices to be confirmed? I'm also interested in times nominations appeared to be contentious even when the Senate aligned with the president's party.

To do this, I will use data on confirmation and nomination dates from the U.S. Supreme Court, as well as historical party data from the Senate and United States Presidency Project.

I could visualize the length of nomination fights. I could also visualize the number of justices each president nominated and how many were confirmed.

This is timely because of the upcoming fight over Brett Kavanaugh, who President Donald Trump recently nominated to the court.

For sources, I could talk to former Senate or White House aides who have worked on Supreme Court nominations. I could also talk to experts, potentially at universities, who study the relationship between the different branches of government.
