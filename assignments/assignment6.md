# Assignment 6: Sketch a visualization

We could create a whole other course devoted to data visualization tools (and those, in fact, do exist: [example 1](https://alignedleft.com/tutorials/d3/about) | [example 2](https://www.tableau.com/learn/training/20203)).

What we were able to cover in this class, though, were the _fundamentals_ that make for a good data visualization. So even if you don't have all the technical skills to create the visualization yet, you should have an idea of what you makes for an effective visualization. 

Without limiting yourself based on the tools you know, sketch a data visualization based on [this data](../class4/cocoabeans.xlsx). It can be done with paper/pencil or using computer software if you're comfortable doing so, or by combining the two. But it should NOT be limited by the abilities you have with the software.

This was originally a challenge in the #makeovermonday data visualization community.

The visualization you create can be simple or more complex: whatever best tells the story you think is interesting from it. 

Your sketch should include:

* A headline
* Chatter/subhed
* The visualization
* Source line: **CBI (Centre for the Promotion of Imports)**
* Credit line (your name)

Here's some inspiration to get you going, but note that NOT ALL OF THESE are good examples to follow. You should be able to tell which ones are effective or not:
