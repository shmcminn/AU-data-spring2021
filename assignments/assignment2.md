# Assignment 2: What's out there

**Due by beginning of class 2**

One of the first steps in taking on any enterprise story is seeing what's been done already. 

In your group, look for any examples you can find of news reports that are similar to the story you'll be working on for your final project. 

Write a summary for your editor (me) of what has already been done and -- more importantly -- what _hasn't_ been done that you hope to tackle. For example, if you're doing a story on increasing police budgets, you might find several articles about inflated police department budgets in cities across the country, but maybe it hasn't been done in DC? Or maybe you're seeing lots of reports on budgets going up -- but you want to see where have police departments actually shrunk, and how that's affected public safety? 

In your summary, include links to the stories you find on your topic.

Be prepared to discuss with me what you find. 

You only need to turn in one assignment for your group, but it would be helpful for me if everyone had a link to it in their Github repo for grading purposes. So it should work something like this:

* One person in group uploads the written markdown file to Github
	* That person shares the URL of the file with other students
* Other students in group create an assignment2.md file with a link to the URL
