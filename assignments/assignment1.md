# Github and Markdown

## Why Github?

For this class, your homework needs to be turned in on Github. Why? Because Github is how many folks who work with code and data share things. The goal of this assignment is to get you to a point where you can comfortably find and share things on github if that's what your collaborators are using. So by the end of this quarter:

* You should be able to commit files to github
* You should be able to find someone else's code/data on github if they direct you to it
* You will have a github profile and a few samples of your own work available on github, showing that you know how to use it

## Why Markdown?

Markdown is a markup language that plays particularly well with github, producing nice, readable documents (like this one!). Since most of our assignments will involve writing, you'll submit them using markdown.

## Assignment

1. Create a Github account. 
1. Create a repository called *AU-data-spring-2021*. You will submit all your homework there. Add your account name to this [Google sheet](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf9OIfKYRPcnt07dgIl5BPCWSg8C7xZ4RHErtlENUbyImGssA/viewform) so I know where to find your homework.
2. Create a new file called assignment1.md
3. Choose a [data-driven investigation from this list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fBslhcz5EjNt4paGkQfCkYgcL69FaarU00B-OskKVQ8/edit?usp=sharing) and critiqiue it [following this template](../critique_template.md).
	* Include a hyperlink (written as `[link text](http://www.linkurl.com)`) to the original story.
1. Write a short pitch, as you would in a note to an editor, for a story idea that could work for the class final project. The pitch should (at least) cover:
	* What interesting question you want to answer
	* What data may be available (or how you could collect your own dataset) to help you answer it
	* Why this story is timely now
	* What types of people you could talk to for sources
	* Anything else important to know
1. Include at least one of the following features in either your critique or story pitch, to show you know how to use markdown:
   * A heading
   * A list or table
1. Commit this assignment in your AU-data-spring-2021 repository.

## Reminder

At the beginning of each class, I will call on two students to share a data story they noticed during the week, so keep your eyes out and come to class prepared with at least one link to a data story.
