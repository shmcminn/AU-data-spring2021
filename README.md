# COMM 618W: Data-Driven Journalism Spring 2021

**Credits**: 3

**Instructor**: Sean McMinn

**Contact**: seanpm92@gmail.com On weekdays, I will try to respond to all emails within 24 hours. If you do not hear from me within that time frame, feel free to send a follow-up email.

**Class time**: 9 a.m. - 5 p.m., Saturdays

**Office hours**: During class or by appointment

**Description**: Reporters find news every day by talking to people and unearthing their secrets. In this class, we're going to do the same — but with data. This is not a graphic design or programming class, but a course that will teach you how to use the huge number of datasets available to reporters in order to break news and help inform your audience through text and visuals. By the end of this course, you should be able to:

* Find datasets relevant to a story you're reporting
* Process and clean data
* Analyze and "interview" data to find a story within it
* Visualize and present a story based on data
* Speak the language of reporters and technologists who use data to tell stories
* Identify common problems with data and think critically about its use in news reporting

Special thank you to [Rachel Shorey](https://github.com/rshorey/digitalframeworks-spring18) of The New York Times for contributions to this class and its syllabus.


### Expectations

* Come to class or let me know if you can't make it. I understand that situations occur that make it difficult to attend, and I'm willing to help you if you get in touch with me. Either way, you will be responsible for the material unless otherwise agreed upon.
* Because there are so few classes, you will only receive one excused absence. **A second absence for any reason will result in you losing half of your attendance points (10% pts. off your grade). A third absence for any reason will earn you a zero on attendance, and you will not be able to earn more than a B- in the class.** After one unexcused absence, an Early Warning notice will be filed to the student’s academic advisor. 
* Complete assignments either in class or as homework due before the next class. That means assignments are due at 9 a.m. on Saturdays, unless otherwise stated.
   * Late assignments will only be accepted if you contact me **before** the class in which it was originally due and we reach an agreement. 
* Submit assignments on Github (instructions in first lecture) as specified in the assignment.
* Consume the news every week, and come to class ready to share at least one story that uses data in a substantial way. I will randomly select two students to share a story at the beginning of class, so please have a link ready to go (and I will do the same). 
* Complete [a final project](finalproject.md)
* I reserve the right to change this syllabus at any time, provided all changes are pushed to GitHub where you can track them in the "commits" section for this repository. If at any time you feel like a change I made isn't fair, you can tell me why and I'll reconsider it.
* Please make sure you have the following software:  
	* Microsoft Excel
	* Sublime text editor (free)
	* Tableau Public (free)
	* We might dabble in some other free software as well, which we can download together. 
* I will use email as the primary means of communicating with the class, making your use a required element. Please make sure you check your AU email daily.
* All lectures/assignments/class materials will be available on Github.


### Grading

Your grade will be made up of three components:

* 20%: Class attendance and participation, including presenting data stories when I call on you to do so
* 50%: Assignments
* 30%: Final project

##### Assignment grading scale

* A: publishable with minimal edits
* B: publishable with significant edits
* C: would need reporter’s revision to be published
	* You cannot get more than a C on an assignment if there are factual errors.
* D: unpublishable, even with edits 
* F: did not complete work as assigned

**Note**: I will attempt to have all assignments graded within one week of you turning them in, and I will send you your assignment grades via email. You can ask questions/for feedback about assignments or grades at any time. If you'd like to see your overall course grade, please talk to me during class and I'll show you a detailed breakdown.

### Collaboration

Students are encouraged to discuss assignments. Your final work, however, must be entirely your own. A good rule of thumb is that no one else should take over your keyboard while completing an assignment. All American University policies regarding cheating apply to this class.

The graphics for this story should be integrated into the story's presentation — not separate pieces. Unless otherwise discussed, the "nut graf" of your story should be something you discovered using the data skills covered in this course. 

### Misc.

#### Discrimination and Harassment (Title IX)

American University expressly prohibits any form of discriminatory harassment including sexual harassment, dating and domestic violence, sexual assault, and stalking. The University is an equal opportunity, affirmative action institution that operates in compliance with applicable laws and regulations. AU does not discriminate on the basis of race, color, national origin, religion, sex (including pregnancy), age, sexual orientation, disability, marital status, personal appearance, gender identity and expression, family responsibilities, political affiliation, source of income, veteran status, an individual's genetic information, or any other bases under federal or local laws in its programs and activities.
 
If you experience any of the above, you have the option of filing a report with the University Police (202-885-2527) or the Office of the Dean of Students (dos@american.edu or 202-885-3300). To file aTitle IX complaint or for more information on your rights, contact the Title IX Program Officer (202-885-3373 orTitleIX@american.edu). Please keep in mind that all faculty and staff who are aware of or witness this conduct are required to report this information to the university, regardless of the location of the incident, with the exception of counselors in the Counseling Center, victim advocates in OASIS, medical providers in the Student Health Center, and ordained clergy in the Kay Spiritual Life Center. For more information, including a list of supportive resources on and off-campus, contact OASIS (oasis@american.edu or 202-885-7070) or check out the comprehensive list of resources to help you find support.

#### Academic Support

In light of the ongoing pandemic, the traditional academic support available to you has shifted. Please refer to AU’s [COVID-19 resources site](https://www.american.edu/coronavirus/) for more information.

#### Academic Integrity

Please don’t even think about cheating on exams or plagiarizing in papers. Plagiarism is to present any information or language that was prepared and written by someone else as if it were your own work. This would include copying and pasting information from the Internet without attributing the source. It would also include passing off another student’s work ask your own.

Standards of academic conduct are set forth in the University’s Academic Integrity Code. By registering, you have acknowledged your awareness of the Academic Integrity Code, and you are obliged to become familiar with your rights and responsibilities as defined by the Code. Violations of the Academic Integrity Code will not be treated lightly, and disciplinary action will be taken should such violations occur.

The Academic Integrity Code includes but is not limited to: plagiarism; inappropriate collaboration; dishonesty in exams, papers; work done for one course and submitted for another; deliberate falsification of data; interference with other students’ work; misrepresenting yourself (or having someone misrepresent you) as present during roll call; and copyright violations.

Please see me if you have any questions about the academic violations described in the Code in general or as they relate to particular requirements for this course.

#### Emergency Preparedness

In the event of an emergency, American University will implement a plan for meeting the needs of all members of the university community.

Should the university be required to close for a period of time, we are committed to ensuring that all aspects of our educational programs will be delivered to our students. These may include altering and extending the duration of the traditional term schedule to complete essential instruction in the traditional format and/or use of distance instructional methods. Specific strategies will vary from class to class, depending on the format of the course and the timing of the emergency.

Faculty will communicate class-specific information to students via AU email and Blackboard, while students must inform their faculty immediately of any absence. Students are responsible for checking their AU email regularly and keeping themselves informed of emergencies.

In the event of an emergency, students should refer to the AU Student Portal and the AU information line at (202) 885- 1100 for general university-wide information, as well as contact their faculty and/or respective dean’s office for the course and school/college-specific information.

Specific to the ongoing pandemic, please continue to monitor AU’s [COVID-19 resources site](https://www.american.edu/coronavirus/), should there be changes.
